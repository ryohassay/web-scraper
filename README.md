# Web Scraper
This program accesses Google and search words listed in `search_words.txt`.

## Environment
I tested this program on Ubuntu 20.04, but it should work on other OS's as well.

## Pre-requisite
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
Move to this directory and run
```
python main.py [browser name]
```
`[browser name]` has to be either `chrome` or `firefox`, whichever you have on your computer.
